        Wildfires are devastating. They're intensifying due largely to climate change, and recent events, such as the fires in Los Angeles, command global action. The featured chart demonstrates one facet of these natural disasters - the destruction of nature. In 2021, Lassen Volcanic National Park was forced to close due to the Dixie Fire. General information about this event can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixie_Fire" target="_blank">here</a>.
